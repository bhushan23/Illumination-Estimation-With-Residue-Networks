## Shading Correcting Net
In this approach, we generate latent lighting representation which is used to correct generated shading using Normal and Spherical Harmonics
Normal and Spherical harmonics might not be able to model the lighting correctly due to varition in SH and Normal which are
rectified by Shading Correcting Network
